##### Why I'm working on ardopcf?

I am interested in supporting further development of systems to use [Winlink](https://winlink.org) for sending and receiving email over long range (HF) radio links using small and energy efficient computers such as the Raspberry Pi Zero (or Zero 2) connected to low power portable radios.  This arrangement should allow licensed amateur radio operators to reliably send and receive email where neither phone nor internet service is available, and using only limited electrical power.  This is important to me because I spend extended periods of time in places with no phone or internet service, and with limited electrical power available from small solar systems.  [Winlink](https://winlink.org) allows me to keep in contact with other licensed amateur radio operators as well as selected friends and family that are not radio operators when I am in such locations.

A variety of [Winlink](https://www.winlink.org) clients exist.  Of particular interest to users of small Linux based computers such as the Raspberry Pi are [Pat Winlink](https://getpat.io) and [WoAD](https://woad.sumusltd.com).  Both of these support the TCP Host Interface connection to ardopc, and thus also work with ardopcf.  [Pat Winlink](https://getpat.io) will run on most any computer, including various models of Raspberry Pi, and it provides an HTTP interface usable through a web browser on any connected device.  [WoAD](https://woad.sumusltd.com) runs on an Andoid phone or tablet.  It can access a radio by using a WiFi connection to a Raspberry Pi or other computer that is running **ardopcf**.

By using **ardopcf** along with either [Pat Winlink](https://getpat.io) or [WoAD](https://woad.sumusltd.com), an entire portable system can consist of the radio and antenna, a Raspberry Pi Zero (or Zero 2), an audio interface such as a [digirig](https://digirig.net) with suitable cables to connect to the radio and the Pi, a small battery to power it all, and a cell phone or tablet (with no cellular or internet connection) to function as a screen and keyboard.  Some radios have a built-in digital interface so that a [digirig](https://digirig.net) or other audio interface device is not required.  The WiFi network required for the phone or tablet to connect to the Raspberry Pi can be generated either by the Pi or by the phone or tablet.

While **ardopcf** is particularly well suited to use with small Linux based computers, binaries for additional platforms are also provided.  Hopefully this will encourage more people to use Ardop rather than exclusively using alternative protocols that are not Open Source, and thus do not allow amateur radio operators to view, modify, experiment with, and extend the software.  I understand that Ardop does not provide the same performance as the commercial VARA HF software.  However, even if you use VARA, I encourage you to also sometimes use ardopcf or any other Ardop implementation.  This not only develops and practices your ability to communicate with stations that are unable or unwilling to run VARA, but it also encourages Winlink gateway operators to continue to support Ardop.  Until a better open source multi-platform radio interface is available and widely adopted by Winlink host programs and gateway operators, I think it is important for Ardop to continue to be supported.

I'm continuing to study DSP and other topics related to writing software for digital radio communication.  Hopefully this will allow me to participate in the future development of open source tools that improve the speed and reliability of such communication.  I believe that open source tools can and should provide performance at least as good as any commercial alternative.  I want to help make that happen.

While it may be more difficult for home built amateur radio hardware to compete with modern commercial hardware than it was in the past, I believe that today's amateur radio operators can and should be working to advance the state of the art of radio communication through software development.  With the free resources available online, it has never been easier for anyone to acquire the software development skills necessary to do so.  Also, unlike development of new hardware which may require specialized tools and materials, software development is possible using the computer that you probably already own.

If you don't want to write software, you can still support open source projects by using the software and providing feedback to the developers, especially if you find bugs that the developers might not be aware of.  Your unique hardware or operating conditions might allow you to identify software bugs that the developers would never be aware of without your help.
