			<p>
			If you see a bright pink box at the top of the page saying 'Connection to
			ardopcf lost. Try reloading this page.', then this page is unable to establish
			a connection with ardopcf, or that connection has been closed.  This can occur
			for a number of reasons.  This will be displayed if the ardopcf program is
			terminated (intentionally or not).  If you are displaying this page on a
			device (computer, table, phone, etc.) other that the one that is running the
			ardopcf program, then this can be caused by a problem with the network (often
			WiFi) connection between them.  It is normal for this message to very briefly
			flash at the top of this page when it first loads.
			</p><p>
			A few different devices can view copies of this Web GUI for that same running
			ardopcf instance.  However, ardopcf will refuse additional connections if too
			many copies try to connect simultaneously.
			</p><p>
			The top of this page shows the current 'ProtocolMode'.  This will be one of
			'ARQ', 'FEC', or 'RXO'.  Next is shown the current Ardop protocol 'State'
			This may be:
			<dl>
				<dt>'DISC'</dt><dd>disconnected</dd>
				<dt>'FECRcv'</dt><dd>receiving Forward Error Correction (FEC) frame</dd>
				<dt>'FECSend'</dt><dd>sending FEC frame</dd>
				<dt>'ISS'</dt><dd>station is the Information Sending Station</dd>
				<dt>'IRS'</dt><dd>station is the Information Receiving Station</dd>
				<dt>'IRStoISS'</dt><dd>transition from 'IRS' to 'ISS'</dd>
				<dt>'IDLE'</dt><dd>idle</dd>
			</dl>
			</p><p>
			The next blank line will show 'PTT' when transmitting and 'Channel Busy' when
			the busy detector detects a signal within Ardop's current bandwidth settings.
			</p><p>
			The next line shows the value of MYCALL and the callsign of the station you
			are connected to or sending Connection Requests (ConReq) to.  MYCALL is
			normally set by the Host program such as Pat Winlink or gARIM.  This should
			be your callsign.  If it has not been set, then it will show '(MYCALL NOT
			SET)'.
			</p><p>
			The spectrum and waterfall plots show from about 300 to 2700 Hz.  If this is
			narrower than the receive filter of your radio, high and/or low pitched audio
			that you hear from your radio may not be visible on these plots.  The thin
			black line in the center of the waterfall display is at 1500 Hz, the center
			frequency for Ardop signals.  The gray or pink lines on each side of the plots
			indicate the aproximate edges of the currently selected ARQ bandwidth (200,
			500, 1000, or 2000 Hz wide).  These lines are not labeled, but their location
			relative to the total bandwidth make it obvious which of these bandwidths they
			represent.
			</p><p>
			The levels shown in the spectrum and waterfall displays are log scale (dB),
			and a very slow automatic gain control is used to try to clearly show the
			relative power levels of signals and noise detected in the available audio.
			User adjustable 'Plot Averaging' may optionally be applied.  Averaging smooths
			out the appearance of noise, which may make it easier to distinguish low
			power signals.  However, it also makes the plots less responsive to quickly
			changing received signals.  If the busy detector fails to recognize a signal
			that you can see or hear within the Ardop bandwidth you intend to use, you
			should not attempt to establish a connection at this time on this frequency,
			because you may interfere with the existing signal.
			</p><p>
			'Plot Scale' may be used to increase the size of all of the plots.  This does
			not change the amount of data being used for the plots, it just magnifies them.
			</p><p>
			Scaling of data for plotting, include averaging, does NOT affect the 'Rcv Level'
			indicator, the busy detector, or ardopcf's abilility to detect or decode data.
			These adjustments are purely for display purposes.
			</p><p>
			The constellation plot provides a visual indicator of the quality of the most
			recently received PSK/QAM frame.  The display shown for FSK frames provides
			less information, but may still be somewhat useful.
			</p><p>
			The 'Rcv Level' graph shows the percentage of full scale used by the received
			audio on a linear scale.  If this level is too high, the audio will be clipped,
			making it harder for ardopcf to decode received signals.  The 'Rcv Level'
			indicates the combined amplitude of everything in your radio's receive
			bandwidth, and is thus not influenced by the Ardop bandwidth settings indicated
			on the spectrum and waterfall plots.  A strong signal outside of the Ardop
			bandwidth can still cause audio clipping.
			</p><p>
			A warning message is shown when excessive audio levels are detected.  This
			message will disappear a few seconds after signal levels drop to more reasonable
			levels.  Low to moderate signal levels seem to usually work well.  Audio levels
			that are too low may also make it more difficult for ardopcf to decode received
			signals.  A warning message is shown when received audio is very low.  However,
			if noise levels are low, the 'Low Audio' warning may be ignored when no signals
			are present.  If the 'Low Audio' warning remains on when ardop signals are being
			received, then increasing the audio level may improve decoding.  Increasing your
			received audio level may also help if you see faint indication of possible ardop
			signals centered on the waterfall display, but ardopcf is not decoding these
			signals.
			</p><p>
			Received audio levels are dependent on the strength of the received signal, on
			your radio's settings as well as on the 'microphone' settings for your computer's
			soundcard.  Details of how to make these adjustments depend on the model of radio
			you are using and on what operating system your computer uses.
			</p><p>
			The 'RX Frame Type' and 'TX Frame Type' displays show what Ardop frame is
			currently being received or sent respectively.  While receiving, the 'RX Frame
			Type' is initially shown with a yellow background.  If this frame is not
			successfully decoded, the background will change to red.  If it is successfully
			decoded, the background will change to green.  The 'TX Frame Type' is normally
			shown with a white background, but a green background is used when sending
			a DataACK frame telling the other station that you correctly received some data.
			A red background is used when sending a DataNAK frame telling the other station
			that you were unable to decode some received data.
			</p><p>
			The 'TX DriveLevel' slider linearly scales the amplitude of the audio sent to
			your radio by ardopcf.  This, along with your radio's settings and the 'speaker'
			settings for your computer's soundcard influence the strength and quality of
			your transmitted radio signal.  This slider control will always be set to to
			100 when ardopcf is first started.  You may want to adjust your radio and
			soudcard settings to levels that allow you to use this convenient slider control
			to make final adjustments to this audio output level.
			</p><p>
			Reduced audio amplitude can be used to decrease the power of your transmitted
			signals.  In addition to limiting your power to only what is required to carry
			out the desired communications [for US Amateur operator this is required by
			Part 97.313(a)], reducing your power output may also be necessary if your radio
			cannot handle transmitting at its full rated power when using high duty cycle
			digital modes.  While sending data, Ardop can have a very high duty cycle as it
			sends long data frames with only brief breaks to hear short DataACK or DataNAK
			frames from the other station.
			</p><p>
			If the output audio is too loud, your radio's Automatic Level Control (ALC) will
			adjust this audio before using it to modulate the RF signal.  This adjustment may
			distort the signal making it more difficult for other stations to correctly
			receive your transmissions.
			</p><p>
			Details of how to monitor the action of your radio's ALC, and how to adjust
			your radio and soundcard settings depend on the model of radio you are using
			and on what operating system your computer uses.
			</p><p>
			The 'Send2Tone' button causes ardopcf to transmit a 5 second two tone signal
			similar, but longer than what is used as the leader at the start of all Ardop
			frames.  This will not be sent if the Protocol 'STATE', as shown near the top
			of this page, is not 'DISC' for disconnected.  An alert is displayed for this
			failure.
			</p><p>
			The 'SendID' button causes ardopcf to transmit an ID frame containing your
			callsign.  If MYCALL has not been set, such that '(MYCALL NOT SET)', then this
			frame cannot be sent, and an alert is displayed instead.  Similarly, this will
			not be sent if the Protocol 'STATE', as shown near the top of this page, is
			not 'DISC' for disconnected.  An alert is displayed for this failure as well.
			If a Maidenhead grid square indicating your location has been set by the Host
			program, this is also included in an ID frame.
			</p><p>
			The various items displayed here can change quickly during an Ardop ARQ
			connection.  The debug log file created by ardopcf contains most of this same
			information and more.  Reviewing its content may be of interest after an
			exchange that failed, or during which you saw something that seemed unusual.
			The 'Show Log' button also provides a list of most of what has been displayed.
			This low window shows less detail than the debug log file, but provides a
			convenient way to review what has occured.  Some entries in the log window are
			timestamped.  These timestamps use the clock of the device you are viewing this
			page on, which may be different from the clock on the device that is running
			the ardopcf program.  Due to this, times shown in the log window may be
			differnt from those written to the debug log file.
			</p><p>
			The 'Clear Log' button (visible only when the log window is visible) may be used
			to discard the contents of this window.  This might be useful before initiating
			a new connection.  The 'Clear Log' button does not influence what is written to
			the debug log file.
