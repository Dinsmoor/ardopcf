# To use this file as input to diagnostichost.py:

# Use the -n or --nohelp command line option to not print the interactive usage instructions
# python diagnostichost.py --nohelp --files example_input.txt

# Lines beginning with a single colon (:) are interpreted as host commands for
# Ardop.  Lines beginning with two colons (::) are interpreted as internal
# commands for diagnostichost.py.

# Commands and Data are sent to Ardop on two different ports.  So, the relative
# order in which Commands and Data are processed may not be the same as the
# order in which they are entered.  A "BUFFER" response is returned on the
# Command port for every block of data submitted to the Data port.  Until that
# "BUFFER" response is received, the data may or may not have been accepted.
# ::pause can be used give Ardop time to respond for non-interactive use.

# Most Ardop host commands are case insensitive

# Allow some time for Ardop to catch up.  For non-interactive use where

# tool that watches for and reacts to responses from Ardop.  That would be much
# more reliable than trying to predict timing.
